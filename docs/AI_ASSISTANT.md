## 🔧 Query Classification

### Pattern Matching

The system uses regex patterns to classify queries:

```python
QUERY_PATTERNS = {
    'pending_tasks': [
        r'show.*pending.*task',
        r'pending.*task',
        r'what.*pending',
        r'list.*pending',
        r'my.*pending'
    ],
    'completed_tasks': [
        r'show.*completed.*task',
        r'completed.*task',
        ...
    ],
    # ... more patterns
}
```

### Examples

| Query | Category | Response |
|-------|----------|----------|
| "Show my pending tasks" | pending_tasks | List of pending tasks |
| "What completed tasks?" | completed_tasks | Recent completions |
| "How's my performance?" | performance | Performance metrics |
| "Assign me a task" | assign_task | Recommended tasks |
| "Show my skills" | skills | Skill proficiency |
